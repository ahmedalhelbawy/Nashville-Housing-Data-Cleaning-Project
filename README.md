## Project Description

This SQL script performs a series of data cleaning operations on the Nashville Housing dataset. The goal is to improve data quality, consistency, and usability for further analysis. The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL and data cleaning techniques.

## Technologies Used

- SQL Server
- T-SQL

## Dataset

The project uses the Nashville Housing dataset, which contains information about property sales in Nashville, Tennessee. The original dataset includes fields such as property addresses, sale dates, sale prices, and other relevant real estate information.

## Data Cleaning Operations

1. Date Standardization
2. Populating Missing Property Addresses
3. Breaking Down Address Components
4. Standardizing Values
5. Removing Duplicates
6. Dropping Unused Columns

## Key SQL Techniques Demonstrated

- Data type conversion
- Self joins for data population
- String manipulation (SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, PARSENAME)
- CASE statements
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Data deletion
- Table alterations (adding and dropping columns)

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have access to a SQL Server environment.
2. Create a database named 'PortfolioProjects' (or modify the script to use your existing database).
3. Import the Nashville Housing dataset into a table named 'NashvilleHousing'.
4. Execute the SQL script in your database environment.
5. Review the results and adjusted data.

## Important Notes

- The script includes cautionary comments about data deletion and column dropping.
- Always backup your data before running cleaning operations.
- Modify the script as needed to fit your specific database structure or naming conventions.

## Potential Improvements

- Implement error handling and transaction management.
- Add data validation steps.
- Create indexes on frequently queried columns for performance optimization.
